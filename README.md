# Recruitment Files Storage

This repository is used as a public file storage for government recruitment-related documents such as:

- Official notifications (PDF)
- Admit cards
- Result notices
- Supporting images

Files are uploaded automatically using Python scripts.
Each file generates a stable public URL via raw.githubusercontent.com,
which is then stored in structured JSON and databases.

This repository does NOT contain application source code.
